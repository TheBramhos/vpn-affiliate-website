Its software is built in Germany \u2013 the place where the company was born. However, for data security reasons, its headquarters are now in Bucharest, Romania.    The reason behind the switch is simple. Romania is one of the most privacy-friendly locations in Europe. Back in 2009, Romania\u2019s Constitutional Court was the first institution to oppose the EU\u2019s Data Retention Directive. And in 2014, it declared the infamous \u2018Big Brother law\u2019 unconstitutional.That\u2019s a big deal because it allows CyberGhost VPN to stay true to its No Log policy. This VPN keeps ZERO logs on your browsing history, traffic destination, data content, or search preferences. For more information, check out CyberGhost\u2019s Transparency Report.    The VPN industry has to be one of the most competitive niches out there. With dozens upon dozens of VPN providers fighting for their share of the market, one thing\u2019s for sure: the options are plenty.And that\u2019s always a good thing. Competitiveness drives innovation and pushes the development of VPN apps above and beyond. And that can only mean one thing: a better experience with increased performance for us, the regular users.However, there\u2019s also a downside to all this. Some of you may be familiar with the term \u2018paradox of choice.\u2019 The more options there are, the harder it is to decide. To help those who are still on the fence, we\u2019ve created this detailed review of CyberGhost VPN \u2013 the VPN we fell in love with.       App design and device compatibility    The VPN app is optimized for all the most popular platforms and operating systems, such as:    WindowsmacOSIOSAndroidAndroid TVAmazon Fire TVAmazon Fire TV StickLinux and other operating systems.    In terms of design, the VPN app has a beautiful look and feel to it. It combines a minimalist look with smooth and intuitive access.             Firing up the app takes only one click or screen tap, depending on the device you\u2019re using it on. And don\u2019t worry about struggling to find the fastest server for your location. CyberGhost VPN does that for you. The app has a built-in feature for that.    On top of this, none of the many app features are more than a couple of mouse clicks away.Clicking the yellow arrows on the bottom left corner opens CyberGhost VPN\u2019s detailed view. Here you can find a list of all available servers, the submenus for torrenting, streaming, NoSpy servers, and your favorites.         Get CyberGhost     CyberGhost VPN automatically blocks ads    You can also go to the Connection features and Smart Rules tabs to tailor CyberGhost VPN to yourspecific needs. What\u2019s more, CyberGhost VPN automatically blocks ads, malicious websites, and automatically ensures you get to the most secure version of any site by turning on the Automated HTTPS Redirect feature.         Get CyberGhost     Smart Rules submenu    From the Smart Rules submenu, you can further tweak the way the app operates. Choose betweenletting the app launch on system startup or give it a specific trigger for it to turn on. There\u2019s also thepossibility of excluding certain websites from the VPN tunnel or personalising the way you want the app to work when connecting to a new Wi-Fi network.         Get CyberGhost     Server location and performance    CyberGhost VPN can be proud of their server fleet size. Its 3600+ servers make this VPN provider one of the best in the market when it comes to sheer numbers. However, one thing makes CyberGhost VPN shine brighter than anyone else out there. That\u2019s the number of countries where this VPN can offer connections to. With VPN servers placed across all four corners of the globe and spreading out across six continents, CyberGhost VPN\u2019s web stretches out to 60 different countries.On top of this, users enjoy specially dedicated servers for streaming, torrenting, and ultimate privacy. And the streaming servers go even one step further in terms of personalisation. You will find VPN servers optimised for specific services like Netflix, BBC iPlayer, Hulu, YouTube, ESPN, Pandora, FoX, and many, many more.    Ok, it\u2019s all good so far, but what about speed? Here\u2019s what we experienced after connecting toCyberGhost VPN\u2019s US Netflix \u2013 which were more than 6000 km away.    First of all, Netflix performed almost flawlessly. We were able to unblock the whole content librarywithout any trouble whatsoever. Second, the TV shows we streamed took seconds to load. Once this process was over, we forgot we were using a VPN.    Security    With 256-bit AES encryption standards, DNS-leak protection and an automatic kill-switch that cuts your connection to the internet when your VPN connection fails, there\u2019s not more you could wish from CyberGhost VPN.    Users also enjoy multiple protocol support and can manually switch between OpenVPN, L2TP, or IKEv2. However, all this would be useless without CyberGhost VPN\u2019s No Log policy. Fortunately, as we already mentioned, the company is super-strict and transparent about keeping no records on anything that its users do online.To top it all off, CyberGhost VPN offers its users an additional NoSpy server stack. These are servers built with extra layers of privacy, with hardware accessed and operated by CyberGhost VPN staff alone. These servers offer dedicate uplinks and a higher bandwidth for improved downloading speed.    Customer service    It\u2019s worth mentioning that the CyberGhost VPN support team is available 24\/7 via email or live chat and can handle your requests in English, German, French, and Romanian.However, we didn\u2019t find it necessary to reach out to them since the VPN experience was as straightforward as it gets. And we rate that as a plus. As a side note, if you\u2019re more of a hands-on type of person, CyberGhost offers detailed installationguides, troubleshooting, and a detailed FAQ page    Awards    At the start of 2019, CyberGhost VPN was awarded the Best Value VPN award.  And to anyone who\u2019s already a user, this should come as no surprise because this VPN delivers unrivalled quality for its users at a bargain price.    Money-back guarantee    CyberGhost VPN wants their Ghosties to be fully satisfied with their product. It\u2019s perhaps why they offer a 45-day money-back guarantee \u2013 the most significant guarantee in the VPN industry.    Final thoughts    CyberGhost VPN delivers all the benefits a VPN could offer you: It keeps you anonymous online; It unblocks Netflix and other popular streaming services; It doesn\u2019t slow your internet connection; It allows you to customize and personalize your app according to your own specific needs; It gives you access to 3600+ VPN servers in 60+ countries so you can breeze through all types of online restrictions and censorship     Get CyberGhost     Related articles:","keywords":"","datePublished":"2020-06-18T15:27:50+00:00","dateModified":"2021-07-23T12:38:10+00:00","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"jv@compriso.com","description":"","url":"https:\/\/vpnexpert.org\/author\/jvcompriso-com\/","sameAs":[],"image":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/75abd2023b11a11a8f662007717c1bae?s=96&d=mm&r=g","height":96,"width":96}},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"vpnexpert.org","url":"https:\/\/vpnexpert.org","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https:\/\/vpnexpert.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/cropped-vpnxpertfavicon.png","width":"512","height":"512"}},"image":{"@type":"ImageObject","@id":"https:\/\/vpnexpert.org\/cyberghost\/#primaryimage","url":"https:\/\/vpnexpert.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/vpnxpert.png","width":"1200","height":"768"}},"reviewedBy":{"@type":"Organization","name":"vpnexpert.org","url":"https:\/\/vpnexpert.org","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https:\/\/vpnexpert.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/cropped-vpnxpertfavicon.png","width":"512","height":"512"}}}]

<h2 id="cyberghost_1" class="joli-heading"><strong>CyberGhost </strong></h2>
<p>Our silver medal goes to the VPN provider CyberGhost. The service is the perfect option for the VPN user who seeks a VPN solution that is offered at a reasonable price and that has all the functions and features that are necessary to get a <a href="../best-vpn/"><strong>good VPN experience</strong></a>. It is easy to use and allows the user to be connected with up to seven devices at the same time (e.g PC, Mac, iPhone, Android). This is a real advantage of the service and one of the highest numbers on the VPN market as the usual standard number is five.</p>
<p>The VPN provider is one of the safest and protecting users&rsquo; privacy is at the core of CyberGhost&rsquo;s service. When you connect to a server through CyberGhost&rsquo;s software, you are protected by 256-bit AES encryption. This means that no one can intercept the data and the information you send and receive.</p>
<p>CyberGhost is based in Romania, you can therefore be sure that no logs are kept or shared to authorities. The amount of connections to each server is logged, but it cannot be traced back to a specific user. This means that information about websites that you have visited, your search history, or IP-addresses are not saved. If you are not using a VPN all of this information is available to your internet service provider. Using a service like CyberGhost is therefore a much safer option for you as an internet user.</p>
<p>By using CyberGhost&rsquo;s VPN service you can easily access <a href="../netflix-usa/"><strong>Netflix</strong></a>, <strong><a href="../hulu-vpn/">Hulu</a></strong>, Disney+, and much more. The service helps you to find servers that are optimised for using these types of streaming services regardless of where in the world you are. If you, for instance, want to access American Netflix from another country than the US, CyberGhost helps you identify an optimal server for doing so. CyberGhost has a vast network of servers around the globe, in fact, more than 7000 servers. This helps to ensure that you can always get a fast server &ndash; no matter where you are or what you want to do.</p>
<p>Another advantage of CyberGhost is that it offers users the opportunity to get a free trial period. Sign up and take part in their 45-days money-back guarantee and try out CyberGhost for free. If you want to continue to subscribe after the trial period, the price is reasonable. It is a little bit more expensive than ExpressVPN and is around 12 US dollars per month. If you sign up for more than two years, the service can, however, get really cheap and you can enjoy the service for less than 3 US dollars per month.</p>
<p>CyberGhost is easy to download to your device regardless of what type you have. Use the service on your iPhone, Android, PC, Mac, or gaming console and enjoy surfing quickly and safely. With your subscription you can be logged in with up to seven devices at the same time, enabling the whole family to use it simultaneously. The fact that you can use the service on up to seven devices is a big reason why the overall review of CyberGhost is positive.</p>
<p>The provider has good customer service that can be reached all day, every day. The features of the service are also easy to use and ideal for a VPN-beginner. You can connect to a VPN by clicking at just one bottom. There are also several useful features such as &ldquo;connection features&rdquo;, which enable you to both block ads and block attempts to track your digital footprints. Overall, CyberGhost is a user-friendly, safe, and quick VPN provider.</p>

<h2 id="about-cg" class="joli-heading">About CyberGhost VPN</h2>
<p>CyberGhost VPN is a mixed breed company. Its software is built in Germany &ndash; the place where the company was born. However, for data security reasons, its headquarters are now in Bucharest, Romania.</p>
<p>The reason behind the switch is simple. Romania is one of the most privacy-friendly locations in Europe. Back in 2009, Romania&rsquo;s Constitutional Court was the first institution to oppose the EU&rsquo;s Data Retention Directive. And in 2014, it declared the infamous &lsquo;Big Brother law&rsquo; unconstitutional.<br>That&rsquo;s a big deal because it allows CyberGhost VPN to stay true to its No Log policy. This VPN keeps ZERO logs on your browsing history, traffic destination, data content, or search preferences. For more information, check out <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="CyberGhost&rsquo;s Transparency Report. (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.cyberghostvpn.com/en_US/transparency-report" target="_blank"><strong>CyberGhost&rsquo;s Transparency Report</strong>.</a></p>
<p>The VPN industry has to be one of the most competitive niches out there. With dozens upon dozens of <a href="../best-vpn/"><strong>VPN providers</strong></a> fighting for their share of the market, one thing&rsquo;s for sure: the options are plenty.<br><br>And that&rsquo;s always a good thing. Competitiveness drives innovation and pushes the development of VPN apps above and beyond. And that can only mean one thing: a better experience with increased performance for us, the regular users.<br>However, there&rsquo;s also a downside to all this. Some of you may be familiar with the term &lsquo;paradox of choice.&rsquo; The more options there are, the harder it is to decide. To help those who are still on the fence, we&rsquo;ve created this detailed review of CyberGhost VPN &ndash; the VPN we fell in love with.</p>

<h2 id="app" class="joli-heading">App design and device compatibility</h2>
<p>The VPN app is optimized for all the most popular platforms and operating systems, such as:</p>
<ul><li>Windows</li><li>macOS</li><li>IOS</li><li>Android</li><li>Android TV</li><li>Amazon Fire TV</li><li>Amazon Fire TV Stick</li><li>Linux and other operating systems.</li></ul>
<p>In terms of design, the VPN app has a beautiful look and feel to it. It combines a minimalist look with smooth and intuitive access.</p>

<p>Firing up the app takes only one click or screen tap, depending on the device you&rsquo;re using it on. And don&rsquo;t worry about struggling to find the fastest server for your location. CyberGhost VPN does that for you. The app has a built-in feature for that.</p>
<p>On top of this, none of the many app features are more than a couple of mouse clicks away.<br>Clicking the yellow arrows on the bottom left corner opens CyberGhost VPN&rsquo;s detailed view. Here you can find a list of all available servers, the submenus for torrenting, streaming, NoSpy servers, and your favorites.</p>

<p>You can also go to the Connection features and Smart Rules tabs to tailor CyberGhost VPN to your<br>specific needs. What&rsquo;s more, CyberGhost VPN automatically blocks ads, malicious websites, and automatically ensures you get to the most secure version of any site by turning on the Automated HTTPS Redirect feature.</p>

<p>From the Smart Rules submenu, you can further tweak the way the app operates. Choose between<br>letting the app launch on system startup or give it a specific trigger for it to turn on. There&rsquo;s also the<br>possibility of excluding certain websites from the VPN tunnel or personalising the way you want the app to work when connecting to a new Wi-Fi network.</p>

</div>
<h2 id="servers" class="joli-heading">Server location and performance</h2>
<p>CyberGhost VPN can be proud of their server fleet size. Its 3600+ servers make this VPN provider one of the best in the market when it comes to sheer numbers. However, one thing makes CyberGhost VPN shine brighter than anyone else out there. <br>That&rsquo;s the number of countries where this VPN can offer connections to. With VPN servers placed across all four corners of the globe and spreading out across six continents, CyberGhost VPN&rsquo;s web stretches out to 60 different countries.<br><br>On top of this, users enjoy specially dedicated servers for streaming, torrenting, and ultimate privacy. And the streaming servers go even one step further in terms of personalisation. You will find VPN servers optimised for specific services like <strong><a href="../netflix-usa/">Netflix</a>, <a href="../how-to-use-bbc-iplayer-from-anywhere-in-the-world/">BBC iPlayer</a>, <a href="../hulu-vpn/">Hulu</a></strong>, YouTube, ESPN, Pandora, FoX, and many, many more.</p>
<p>Ok, it&rsquo;s all good so far, but what about speed? Here&rsquo;s what we experienced after connecting to<br>CyberGhost VPN&rsquo;s US Netflix &ndash; which were more than 6000 km away.</p>
<p>First of all, Netflix performed almost flawlessly. We were able to unblock the whole content library<br>without any trouble whatsoever. Second, the TV shows we streamed took seconds to load. Once this process was over, we forgot we were using a VPN.</p>
<h2 id="security" class="joli-heading">Security</h2>
<p>With 256-bit AES encryption standards, DNS-leak protection and an automatic kill-switch that cuts your connection to the internet when your VPN connection fails, there&rsquo;s not more you could wish from CyberGhost VPN.</p>
<p>Users also enjoy multiple protocol support and can manually switch between OpenVPN, L2TP, or IKEv2. However, all this would be useless without CyberGhost VPN&rsquo;s No Log policy. Fortunately, as we already mentioned, the company is super-strict and transparent about keeping no records on anything that its users do online.<br><br>To top it all off, CyberGhost VPN offers its users an additional NoSpy server stack. These are servers built with extra layers of privacy, with hardware accessed and operated by CyberGhost VPN staff alone. These servers offer dedicate uplinks and a higher bandwidth for improved downloading speed.</p>
<h2 id="customer-service" class="joli-heading">Customer service</h2>
<p>It&rsquo;s worth mentioning that the CyberGhost VPN support team is available 24/7 via email or live chat and can handle your requests in English, German, French, and Romanian.<br><br>However, we didn&rsquo;t find it necessary to reach out to them since the VPN experience was as straightforward as it gets. And we rate that as a plus.<br> <br>As a side note, if you&rsquo;re more of a hands-on type of person, CyberGhost offers detailed<strong><a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" installation
guides (opens in a new tab)" href="https://support.cyberghostvpn.com/hc/en-us/categories/201457209-Guides" target="_blank"> installation<br>guides</a>, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="troubleshooting (opens in a new tab)" href="https://support.cyberghostvpn.com/hc/en-us/categories/201568945-Troubleshooter" target="_blank">troubleshooting</a></strong>, and a detailed FAQ page</p>
<h2 id="awards" class="joli-heading">Awards</h2>
<p>At the start of 2019, CyberGhost VPN was awarded the Best Value VPN award. And to anyone who&rsquo;s already a user, this should come as no surprise because this VPN delivers unrivalled quality for its users at a bargain price.</p>
<h2 id="money-back" class="joli-heading">Money-back guarantee</h2>
<p>CyberGhost VPN wants their Ghosties to be fully satisfied with their product. It&rsquo;s perhaps why they offer a 45-day money-back guarantee &ndash; the most significant guarantee in the VPN industry.</p>
